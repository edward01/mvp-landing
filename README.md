###Installation###

Just take the `emailList` module out of this repo, install it in your own Django project, change the HTML/CSS links to your own (but retaining the form or similar) and users should be able to submit their name and email to you which goes in to your database back end in to a table called `emailList_email` with their correctly formatted names (first, middle and last where applicable).
